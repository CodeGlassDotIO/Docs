This view contains the general statistics of the profiled application.
The statistics are updated in real-time while the application is running.

In the toolbar, you have multiple buttons. Each of them are described below.
- Show [current application instance filters](../../features/ProfilingDataFiltering#application-instance-filters).
- Show [application instance start filters](../../features/ProfilingDataFiltering#application-instance-start-filters).
- Apply no filters.
- Collapse all items in the tree view.
- Open the [snapshot](../../views/applicationInstanceDockWindow/StatsSnapshotView) menu.
- Toggle showing memory statistics in the tree view (this options is automatically enabled if you have memory profiling enabled).

Below all these buttons, there is a search bar (Ctrl + F). Here you search for method using its name. When you select one of the suggestions, it will automatically expand the tree view until the searched method.
