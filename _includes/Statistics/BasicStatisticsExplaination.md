This view contains the general statistics of the profiled application by namespace, classes, methods, etc.
The statistics are updated in real-time while the application is running.

In the toolbar, you have multiple options; the first 3 define what data you want to see. The options are:
- [Current application instance filters](../../features/ProfilingDataFiltering#application-instance-filters)
- [Application Instance Start Filters](../../features/ProfilingDataFiltering#application-instance-start-filters)
- Show all, CodeGlass will apply no filter.

Nest to that, you also have to option to collapse all items in the tree view.<br/>
The last one is to reset the current Shortest and Longest call; this will be expanded on in the future to reset more statistics. ([Roadmap](../../Roadmap/StatisiticsSnapshots))
