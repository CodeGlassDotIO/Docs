The view above shows a list of all possible filters based on previous application instances. If you do not want to first run your application before being able to set your filter, you can use our decompiler to extract all possible filters for you.

The quickest way to decompile your application is by clicking the "Search" button in the bottom left.
You can also click the "Search Root Folder" button and decompile any decompilable files that it finds in the same folder as the target application is in.

When you click on advanced you will get the following view:

![assets/img/ApplicationSettingsWindow/ApplicationFiltersAdvanceDecompile.png](../../../assets/img/ApplicationSettingsWindow/ApplicationFiltersAdvanceDecompile.png)

Here you can select which files you would like to decompile.

See [Feature - Decompilation for filters](../../features/Decompilation) for more information about decompilation.
