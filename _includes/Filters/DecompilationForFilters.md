The collection of preview data to run the filters against in the screenshot above are from previous ran instances, if you do not want to first start the application before you can see how your filters behave you can choose to decompile the application.


The quickest one is decompile the target application by clicking on the Search button in the bottom left.
You can also click the "Search Root Folder" button and decompile any decompilable files it finds in the same folder that the target application is in.

When you click on advanced you will get the following view:

![assets/img/ApplicationSettingsWindow/ApplicationFiltersAdvanceDecompile.png](../../../assets/img/ApplicationSettingsWindow/ApplicationFiltersAdvanceDecompile.png)

Here you can select wich files you would like to decompile.

See [Feature - Decompilation for filters](../../features/DecompilationForFilters) for more information about decompilation.
