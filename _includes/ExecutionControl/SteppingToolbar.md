Stepping is only possible when the application is not actively running.

The button description in order:
- [Steps back out](../../features/ApplicationInstanceStepping#step-back-out) (Ctrl + Shift + F11) the current function back to before the current function was called
- [Steps back over](../../features/ApplicationInstanceStepping#step-back-over) (Ctrl + F10) the previous function
- [Steps back into](../../features/ApplicationInstanceStepping#step-back-into) (Ctrl + F11) the previous function
- [Steps into](../../features/ApplicationInstanceStepping#step-into) (F11) the next function
- [Steps over](../../features/ApplicationInstanceStepping#step-over) (F10) the next function
- [Steps out](../../features/ApplicationInstanceStepping#step-out) (Shift + F11) the current function

To stop a long running stepping operation (like step out) you can use the pause toolbar or menu button or press pause/break key on your keyboard.
