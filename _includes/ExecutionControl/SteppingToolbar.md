- [Steps Back Over](../../features/ApplicationInstanceStepping#step-back-over) (Ctrl + F10) the previous function
- [Steps Back Into](../../features/ApplicationInstanceStepping#step-back-into) (Ctrl + F11) the previous function
- [Steps Into](../../features/ApplicationInstanceStepping#step-into) (F11) the next function
- [Steps Over](../../features/ApplicationInstanceStepping#step-over) (F10) the next function
- [Steps Out](../../features/ApplicationInstanceStepping#step-out) (Shift + F11) the current function

To stop a long running stepping operation (Like Step Out) you can use the pause toolbar or menu button or press Pause/Break key on your keyboard.
