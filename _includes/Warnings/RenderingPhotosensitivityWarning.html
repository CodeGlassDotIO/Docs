<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<h4 class="alert-heading">Photosensitivity warning</h4>
Because of the nature of the realtime rendering and thread colors it might have a strobing effect that may affect photosensitive users. <br/>
No one of us is photosensitive so we cant test it and we did not have any reports from users however we wanted to warn you anyway because we imagine that it can. <br/>
Better safe than sorry right?
