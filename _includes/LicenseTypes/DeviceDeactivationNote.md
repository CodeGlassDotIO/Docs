*There is a variable limit on how many times you can remove a device activation, contact us when you reached it so we can increase it for you, this is a method to prevent license sharing, just [contact](/Docs/contact) us (sending a quick [discord](/Docs/contact#discord) message is enough) when you reached it so we can reset it for you.*<br/>
*<b>Note: Uninstalling the application does not remove the device activation due to limitations of our license provider</b>*
