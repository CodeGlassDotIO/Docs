*This does not mean that the software can't be used offline. This just means that when you log in for the first time we have to validate your license.
And sometimes it will do that check again when you restart the application.*

*If CodeGlass for any reason fails to validate your license it will still grant you access to the [Community]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/Editions/Trial) tier, so you do not have to worry not being able to use CodeGlass, just not to its fullest if you had a higher tier.*

*Yes this means that if you did not have a license at al and make it purposely fail you can access the [Community Edition]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/Editions/Trial) without having a license at all, however we rather have this vulnerability than have a situation like our license provider having an outage and no-one having access to CodeGlass anymore.
If someone wants to pirate CodeGlass they will find a way anyway, we just hope you would rather support us.*
