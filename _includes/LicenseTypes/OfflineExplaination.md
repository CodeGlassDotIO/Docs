*This does not mean that the software cant be used offline, it is just that when you log in for the first time that we have to validate your license.
And it will sometimes do that check agian when you restart the application.*

*If it for any reason fails to validate your license it will still grant you access to the [Community]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/Editions/Community) tier, so you do not have to worry not being able to use CodeGlass, just not to its fullest if you had a higher tier.*

*Yes this means that if you did not have a license at al and make it purposely fail you can access the [community edition]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/Editions/Community) without having a license at all, however we rather have this funerability than have a situation like our license provider having an outage and no-one having access to CodeGlass anymore.
If someone wants to pirate CodeGlass they will find a way anyway, we just hope you would rather support us.*
