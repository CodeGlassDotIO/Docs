The Experimental subscription is the highest tier of license we provide to individuals and provides many things.
It allows the user to use [Pro Edition](../Editions/Pro) and [Experimental Edition](../Editions/Experimental) for commersial use

The [Experimental Edition](../Editions/Experimental) that is an experimental build with many experimental and new features or tweaks that are not stable enough for the Pro Edition.
The Experimental edition may even contain features or tweaks that will never come to the Pro Edition.

This type of license is ment for people that wants to be involved and support the development of Code Glass, as the Experimental Edition can be very buggy on some builds.
This is also why they have access to the [Pro Edition](../Editions/Pro).
