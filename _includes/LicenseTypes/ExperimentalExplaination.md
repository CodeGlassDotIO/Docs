The experimental subscription is the highest tier of license we provide to individuals and provides many things. It is only available on request, and pricing is decided per request.
It allows the user to use [Pro Edition](../Editions/Pro) and [Experimental Edition](../Editions/Experimental) for commercial use.

The [Experimental Edition](../Editions/Experimental) is an experimental build with many experimental and new features or tweaks that are not stable enough for the Pro Edition.
The Experimental edition may even contain features or tweaks that will never come to the Pro Edition.

This type of license is intended for people that wants to be involved and support the development of CodeGlass, as the Experimental Edition can be very buggy on some builds.
This is also why they have access to the [Pro Edition](../Editions/Pro).
