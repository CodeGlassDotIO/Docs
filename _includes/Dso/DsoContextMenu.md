When you right click an item you have the following options:
- Open in item view, this opens the [function detail](CodeMemberDetailsView) or [object detail](ObjectDetailsView) view.
- Open in [Visual Studio](../../features/OpenInVisualStudio).

You can [filter](../../features/ProfilingDataFiltering) the item by:
- Filter (Remove all allowed access modifiers)
- Don't Filter (Allowing All Access Modifiers)
- Change its [allowed access modifiers](../../features/ProfilingDataFiltering#access-modifiers) (Under Advanced)
- Filter the items on the right. This way you can apply filters to all the functions called from here.
