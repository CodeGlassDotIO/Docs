# About Us
We're CodeGlass, an ambitious startup based in the Netherlands, dedicated to building the ultimate next-generation profiler and tooling — accessible to everyone.

We’re already making significant strides with the current version of CodeGlass, but there’s still much more on our roadmap. With your support, we’ll bring those ideas to life.


## Our Vision.
To develop the best solution in full transparency, free from marketing gimmicks, making it truly available to all. 

## Open Source promise
While CodeGlass isn’t open-source, if the day ever comes when no one is left to support it, we’ll release the source code for free. That way, others can learn from it, and you won’t have to worry about losing access.
