# About CodeGlass
CodeGlass is an ambitious developer tooling company based in the Netherlands. We are focused on building the next-generation profiler—designed for real-world complexity and accessible to engineers at every level.

While the current version of CodeGlass already delivers meaningful insights, our roadmap includes significant enhancements that will continue to push boundaries. Your feedback and engagement help shape what comes next.

## Our Vision
To build the most effective, transparent developer tooling—free from marketing fluff, driven by real user needs, and available to all.

## Open Source Commitment
CodeGlass is not currently open-source. However, in the unlikely event that development ceases, we commit to releasing the source code freely. This ensures the community retains access, can continue learning from it, and is not left without support.
