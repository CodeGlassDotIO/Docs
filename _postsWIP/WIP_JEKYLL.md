# WIP BLOG ABOUT JEKYLL.

THIS IS NOT A REAL BLOG POST, JUST A WIP FILE for when we might make one.


This one is about our experience working with Jekyll making this document website.

- Use relative links everywhere you can, especially if you plan to publish it as a github webpage (due to _config.baseurl)
- use https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-relative-links, and give all links the .md, so you can click in VS code but also in github between pages.
- Visual studio code extension: HTTP/s and relative link checker ( https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blackmist.LinkCheckMD) is nice to check for dead links.
Lacks on allot of fronts but it is the best i could find that also worked.

I could not get https://www.supertechcrew.com/jekyll-check-for-broken-links/ to work properly within my time frame on windows, maybe make a bounty for it?
