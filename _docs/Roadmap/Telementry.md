# Telemetry
Adding opt-in of telemetry.

Its not that we want to add this, however its probably a necessary evil we have to add in the future.
To clarify, this will never mean that we send any of your (source) code related data to us, we are talking about feature usage for example.

This is to prevent us from spending time on features that are rarely used for example.
