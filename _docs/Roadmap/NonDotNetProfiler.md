# A non .NET profiler.
Yes we are not yet telling what it is and what runtime it is, but it is not part of .NET and it fits well with the uniqueness of Code Glass Itself.
And we already have a working prototype.

We are sorry to keep you guys in the dark, but it is going to be epic and do not want to spoil the supprise.

But if you think CodeGlass is awesome, you will think that this is too!


It will be released in the near future for the [Experimental Edition](../Editions/Experimental.md) first.
