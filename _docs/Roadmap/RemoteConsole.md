# Remote Console
Currently it is already possible to [attach or open the console](../features/AttachConsole.md) of an application.
However it will open this console on the machine the application runs on, which does not have to be the same pc as the [client](../features/CodeGlassClient.md) runs on, due to a [remote hub](../features/CodeGlassHub.md#remote-hub).
Because of this we want to make a remote console in Code Glass so you can see the console from wherever you open the [client](../features/CodeGlassClient.md)
