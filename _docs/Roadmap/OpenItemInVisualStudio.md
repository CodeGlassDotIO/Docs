# Open Item in Visual Studio
We want to automatically match profiled items with items in Visual Studio because it might be pretty handy for the user.

However, we do have some concerns about this; this idea started not to have to decompile your application for the code as we do not want any knowledge of your code.

But maybe giving us access to your visual studio solution to fully index it might be even worse...?

Feel free to give your opinion about this.
