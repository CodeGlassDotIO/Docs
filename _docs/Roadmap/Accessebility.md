# Accessability

At CodeGlass we want to help by providing better accessability.

## Color Blind Mode
Currently we are not offering some sort of mode for the various types of color blindness, however we would love to have it! 
So if you are color blind please contact us so we can work on a solution and make this program better together!

## Multiple Languages
We want to support multiple languages in the future.

## Touchscreen Support
Adding touchscreen support to CodeGlass.
