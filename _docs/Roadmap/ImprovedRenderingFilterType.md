# Improved Render filtering
![assets/img/ApplicationInstanceWindow/RealtimeRenderingContextMenu.png](../../../assets/img/ApplicationInstanceWindow/RealtimeRenderingContextMenu.png)

Currently [rendering](../features/RealtimeRendering.md) only listens to the [current filters](../features/profilingdatafiltering.md#application-instance-filters), we want to improve this that it listens to the [other filter groups](../features/profilingdatafiltering.md#filter-groups) as well
