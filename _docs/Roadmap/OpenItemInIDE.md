# Open Item in IDE
Just like with Visual Studio we want to automatically match profiled items with items in the IDE of the user because it might be pretty handy for the user.

However, we do have some concerns about this; this idea started not to have to decompile your application for the code as we do not want any knowledge of your code.

But maybe giving us access to your IDE solution to fully index it might be even worse...?

Feel free to give your opinion about this.
