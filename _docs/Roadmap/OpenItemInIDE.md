# Open Item in IDE
Just like with Visual Studio we want to automatically match profiled items with items in the IDE of the user because it might be pretty handy for the user.

However, we do have some concerns about this; this idea started not to have access to your source code as we do not want any knowledge of your code.
We still wont as your CodeGlass instance wont send us anything, but you have to take our word for that.  

Feel free to give your opinion about this.
