#  Compare Profiling Snapshots
It is currently possible to manually compare [snapshots](../features/ProfilingSnapshots.md) however we would like to make it possible to automatically detect differences between the snapshots.


# use cases examples:
You make a sample of the login sequence of an application how it should behave normally and store this in the repository of the applciation.
Now when in the future login failes you load in the sample and compare it
