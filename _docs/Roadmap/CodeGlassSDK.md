# Code Glass SDK
Sdk to control certain parts of CodeGlass from within the application when you try to profile the application with CodeGlass

For example: 
- [Soft on / soft off profiling](../features/ApplicationInstanceExecutionControl.md#soft-off), 
- [Profiling data filters](../features/ProfilingDataFiltering.md) 
- [Make a snapshot](../features/ProfilingSnapshots.md)
- [Creating filter presets](../Roadmap/FilterPreset.md) by e.g. adding preset attributes by the code that handles Login to make a login preset.
- [Exception handling](../Roadmap/ImprovingExceptions.md)
- [Enable disable time collection](ExcludeFunctionTime.md)
