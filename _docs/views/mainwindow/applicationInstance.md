# Application Instances
![assets/img/mainwindow/MainMenuAppInstances.png](../../../assets/img/MainMenu/MainMenuAppInstances.png)
On this view you see all the instances that were started since the [Code Glass Hub](../../features/CodeGlassHub.md) started.
You can [view the profiled instance](../ApplicationInstanceDockWindow.md)  by double clicking on them or pressing on the "Open" button on the bottom right.

From this view it is also possible to [start a new instance](../ApplicationInstanceDockWindow.md), [Remove the current application](#remove-application) and open the [Application Settngs](../ApplicationSettingsWindow.md)

You can also add an Application by the log file you created with the [Profiling Snapshots](../../features/ProfilingSnapshots.md) by pressing the "Add by log file" button.
If the new instance does not show up make sure that you used a log file from this application, you can check the [applications](application.md) to be sure.

You also see the placeholder button for [Roadmap - Attach To Running Applications](../../Roadmap/RunningApplication.md)

# Remove application
![assets/img/mainwindow/RemoveApplicationConfirmation.png](../../../assets/img/MainMenu/RemoveApplicationConfirmation.png)

When you press the "Remove Application" button you will get this Confirmation window.

This window states that the application will first be archived and removed after the [Code Glass Hub](../../features/CodeGlassHub.md) restarts. <br/>
This is to ensure data integrety, the full removal of the application data and prevent unexpected behaviour if others are logged in into the same Hub and profiling that application.
