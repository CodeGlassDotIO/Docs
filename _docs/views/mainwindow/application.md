# Applications View
![assets/img/mainwindow/Applications.png](../../../assets/img/MainMenu/Applications.png)

On this view you see all the applications that were previously added to CodeGlass and you can [open them](applicationInstance.md) to start profiling them by double clicking on them or pressing the "Open" button on the bottom right.

You can add new applications by pressing the "[add an application button](newapplication.md)" on the right. 

You can also add an application by a log file you created with the [profiling snapshots](../../features/ProfilingSnapshots.md) by pressing the "Add by log file" button. <br/>
If the application is already known to this client it will not add another application but open a new [instance](applicationInstance.md) instead

You can also connect to a [remote CodeGlass hub](../../features/CodeGlassHub.md#remote-hub) by pressing the "[Connect to another hub](#connect-to-another-hub)" button.

You can also decide to logout and quit CodeGlass by clicking on the "Logout and Quit" button.



## Connect to another hub
![assets/img/mainwindow/MainMenuConnectToAnotherHub.png](../../../assets/img/MainMenu/MainMenuConnectToAnotherHub.png)

Here you can connect to a different [CodeGlass Hub](../../features/CodeGlassHub.md), after pressing connect the application will restart and connect to the other hub.
