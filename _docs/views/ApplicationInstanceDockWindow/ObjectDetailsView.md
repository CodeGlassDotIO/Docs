# Object Details View

{% include alert.html  type="warning" title="Functions do not use this view" content="This view is used by all object types except for functions, they use the <a href=\"CodeMemberDetailsView\" >code member details view</a>." %}

This view looks and works allot like the [statistics view](StatisticsWindow.md), the only difference is that it only shows the data from this object instead of the whole profiled application.

{% include Statistics/BasicStatisticsExplaination.md %}
