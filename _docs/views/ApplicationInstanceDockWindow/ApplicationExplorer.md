![assets/img/ApplicationInstanceWindow/AppInstanceApplicationExplorerContextMenu.png](../../../assets/img/ApplicationInstanceWindow/AppInstanceApplicationExplorerContextMenu.png)

The Application Explorer shows you the collected data objects, like classes and methods / functions, from the profiled application.

On this screen you can easily manage what you want to [filter](../../features/ProfilingDataFiltering.md) by right clicking or open the the [object details view](ObjectDetailsView.md) by double clicking on them.

The items you see are based on the [application instance filters](../../features/ProfilingDataFiltering.md#application-instance-filters) you select and apply, light gray items mean that the item is partially filtered and dark gray are fully filtered

More details below.
