# Main Window
![assets/img/ApplicationInstanceWindow/AppInstanceMainWindow.png](../../../assets/img/ApplicationInstanceWindow/AppInstanceMainWindow.png)

This is the default window you see when you [start a new instance](../mainwindow/applicationInstance).

This just gives you a nice dashboard of your application, we might add more dashboard items in the future here.


You can click "Bring process to front" to bring the profiling application in front.


{% include alertNoTitle.html  type="info" content="The profiled functions value is calculated by the amount of calls and returns happend devided by 2." %}
