# Main Window
![assets/img/ApplicationInstanceWindow/AppInstanceMainWindow.png](../../../assets/img/ApplicationInstanceWindow/AppInstanceMainWindow.png)

This is the default window you see when you [start a new instance](../mainwindow/applicationInstance).

This just gives you a nice dashboard of your application, we are planning to add more dashboard items in the future here.

{% include alertNoTitle.html  type="info" content="The profiled functions value is calculated by the amount of calls and returns that happened and that divided by 2." %}
