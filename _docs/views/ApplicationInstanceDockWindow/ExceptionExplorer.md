The exception explorer shows the collected exceptions; the amount is limited by the maximum set in the [applications profiler settings](../ApplicationSettingsWindow.md)

The list is ordered from newest to oldest.

When you double click an exception, it opens the [exception details view](ExceptionDetailsView.md).
