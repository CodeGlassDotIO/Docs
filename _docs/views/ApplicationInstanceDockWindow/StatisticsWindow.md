## Memory Statistics
If you have an [experimental license](../../Editions/Experimental.md) and you have memory profiling enabled in the [application settings](../ApplicationSettingsWindow.md), this view will also give insight in the memory usage per namespace, class and method.<br>
In this view you can choose to toggle the visibility of the memory statistics by pressing the "Toggle Memory Stats" button.
