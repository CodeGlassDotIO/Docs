This is the default window you see when you [start a new instance](../mainwindow/applicationInstance).
This just gives you a nice dashboard of your application, we might add more dashboard items in the future here.

From here you can access all the functionalities that CodeGlass has to offer. In the pages listed below you can find a more in depth explanation of all our features.
