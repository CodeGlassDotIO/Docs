# Available Subscription

## For Businesses and Organisations
[Legal Entities](#legal-entity) qualify for the  [Orginisation subscription](LicenseTypes/OrganisationSubscription.md)  plan. A [legal Entity](#legal-entity) may use the software under [Orginisation subscription](LicenseTypes/OrganisationSubscription.md)  on any computer, operating system, and by any developer within a legal entity, provided that the total number of concurrent users never exceeds the number of subscriptions purchased by that legal entity.

We also have an [Offline Organisation](LicenseTypes/OfflineOrganisationSubscription.md) plan if that better suits your need.

If you are not sure that ([Offline](LicenseTypes/OfflineOrganisationSubscription.md)) [Orginisation](LicenseTypes/OrganisationSubscription.md) subscription is right for you, check the [subscription comparison matrix](#license-comparison).

## For Individual Developers
The [Pro subscription](LicenseTypes/ProSubscription.md) is for many the most fitting as this allows you to use it commercially and get the full [Pro Edition](Editions/Pro.md) of Code Glass, you can even use funds or be reimbursted by a [legal Entity](#legal-entity) for it.

We als have to [Enthousiast Subscription](LicenseTypes/EnthousiastSubscription.md), this is a cheaper option for the [Pro Edition](Editions/Pro.md) and you still support the further development of Code Glass but it has some rules.
The Enthousiast Subscription is only allowed to a individual, using it not within a [legal Entity](#legal-entity) in non-commercial use and using your own funds and do not use funds of a [legal Entity](#legal-entity) in any way or form, nor be reimbursed you for it.

However even if you have no funds we have you covered with the [Community license](LicenseTypes/CommunityLicense.md), by with you get the [Community Edition](Editions/Community.md) of Code Glass, please keep in mind that this should not be used in commercial use.
But you could also get a [Enthousiast Subscription](LicenseTypes/EnthousiastSubscription.md) for free by:
- Getting it as a [reward](Others/Rewards.md) For being an active member in the [community](Others/Community.md) that helping others with questions, helping us out, providing quality feedback, etc. (Keep in mind that handing these out is a manual process, and beggers are not choosers. )
- Completing or participating in a [bounty](Others/Rewards.md#bounties)
