# Available Subscription

## For Businesses and Organisations
Legal Entities qualify for the [Enterprise Subscription](LicenseTypes/EnterpriseSubscription.md) plan. A legal entity may use the software under [Enterprise Subscription](LicenseTypes/EnterpriseSubscription.md)  on any computer, operating system, and by any developer within a legal entity, provided that the total number of concurrent users never exceeds the number of subscriptions purchased by that legal entity.

We also have an [Offline Enterprise](LicenseTypes/OfflineEnterpriseSubscription.md) plan if that better suits your need.

If you are not sure that ([Offline](LicenseTypes/OfflineEnterpriseSubscription.md)) [Enterprise](LicenseTypes/EnterpriseSubscription.md) subscription is right for you, check the [subscription comparison matrix](#license-comparison).

## For Individual Developers
The [Pro Subscription](LicenseTypes/ProSubscription.md) is for many the most fitting as this allows you to use it commercially and get the full [Pro Edition](Editions/Pro.md) of CodeGlass, you can even use funds or be reimbursed by a legal entity for it.


## For the real supporter or those that just want all the toys
