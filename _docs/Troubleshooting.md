# Troubleshooting

## Getting Help
To get help on a specific view you can press F1 in the CodeGlass [client](features/CodeGlassClient.md) to go directly to the correct document page of that view. <br/>

It should only bring you to this page when you use the [help menu item](views/ApplicationInstanceDockWindow/MenuBar.md#view-help). <br/> 
In any other case that it bought you to this page we have messed up... and you would do a huge favour by [reporting this issue](#reporting-issues).

You can also find the documentation yourself from finding it in the [view pages](views.md), starting from the [splash screen](views/Splashscreen.md)

If that did not get you the help you needed please see [getting support](#getting-support)

You can also run this website locally to make sure you always have access to it even without internet, you can find more info about this in the [Github]({{ site.repo }}){:target="_blank"} readme.md file.

## Getting Support
We love to help you out with any problems that you have, but it comes with a brutally honest truth that support is the most expensive part of CodeGlass, so any help in that regard is very much appreciated :)

So please before contacting us please check and collect the following:
- Check [getting help](#getting-help), [sending feedback](#sending-feedback) and [reporting issues](#reporting-issues) sections first.
- Check if your issue is already known in the [github issues]({{ site.repo }}/issues){:target="_blank"}
- Update to the newest version of CodeGlass if possible.
- Collect as much information that might be related to your issue as possible before contacting us, like:
    - Url to the view or feature from this website that relates to your issue
    - Version of CodeGlass you are running 
    - Windows Version (and build number)
    - Screenshots of your issue 
    - A sample repository in which the problem occurs.
    - Step by step instruction on how to recreate the issue
    - Stacktraces from [event viewer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Viewer){:target="_blank"}

Again we love to help, but if you can do as many of the ground work for us that would be really appreciated. 

We recommend contacting us through the [github issues]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new/choose){:target="_blank"}, as then we can manage support, [feedback](#sending-feedback) and [issue](#reporting-issues) tickets in one place, however you can also [contact us](../pages/contact.md) directly.

You can create a github issue by clicking [here]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new/choose){:target="_blank"}.

## Sending Feedback
We encourage you to send any feedback you have, as we try to create the best program together with you all :)

We recommend sending your feedback to us through the [github issues]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new/choose){:target="_blank"}, as then we can manage support, [feedback](#sending-feedback) and [issue](#reporting-issues) tickets in one place, however you can also [contact us](../pages/contact.md) directly.

We created 2 templates on github for providing feedback:
- Is the feedback CodeGlass documentation orientated click [here]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=documentation-feedback-or-issue.md&title=){:target="_blank"}
- Is the feedback CodeGlass as program orientated click [here]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Product&template=codeglass-feedback.md&title=){:target="_blank"}

Again we thank you for providing us with feedback.

## Suggesting features
We want to make CodeGlass the best software product that there is, and with your help that is possible.

So if you have an idea for a new feature please request it! 

However we would like to remind you that we are also human after all and are also limited to 24 hours a day, sadly enough.....
So it might take a while before we added your feature, but you will be added to the [credits](Others/Credits) when we do :)

We recommend sending your feature request as a [github issue]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new/choose){:target="_blank"}, as then we can manage [support](#getting-support), [feedback](#sending-feedback) and [issue](#reporting-issues) tickets in one place, however you can also [contact us](../pages/contact.md) directly.

You can create a feature request with our github template by clicking [here]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=){:target="_blank"}.

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter any issue in the documentation or the software please don't hesitate to report this to us, with your help we can make CodeGlass better!

We recommend sending your issue to us through the [github issues]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new/choose){:target="_blank"}, as then we can manage [support](#getting-support), [feedback](#sending-feedback) and [issue](#reporting-issues) tickets in one place, however you can also [contact us](../pages/contact.md) directly.

If your issue is software based you can use its github template by clicking [here]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-and-issue-report.md&title=){:target="_blank"}

If your issue is documentation based you can use its github template by clicking [here]({{ site.repo }}/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=documentation-feedback-or-issue.md&title=){:target="_blank"}
or you can edit the page directly and create a [pull request]({{ site.repo }}/edit/master/{{ page.path }}){:target="blank"} which would be really helpful to us!
