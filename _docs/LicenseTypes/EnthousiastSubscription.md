# Enthusiasts Subscription
{% include alert.html  type="warning" title="We do not offer this yet, but below you can see our idea about it" %}
Enthusiasts are users that support further development of this program by either paying or helping out in the [community](/docs/Others/Community.md), and we can't be more grateful to this group of users!

The Enthusiast license is available to Private Individuals to use the [Pro Edition](../Editions/Pro.md) of CodeGlass for non-commercial use.

See the [EULA](#eula) for the legal mumbo jumbo.


## How To become an Enthusiasts 
You can become an enthusiast by [paying for an enthusiast subscription fee](#priceing)

or for free by:

- Becoming one for being an active member in the [community](../Others/Community.md) that helping others with questions, helping us out, providing quality feedback, etc. (Keep in mind that handing these out is a manual process, and beggars are not choosers. )
- Getting it as a [reward](../Others/Rewards.md) for example by Completing or participating in a [bounty](../Others/Rewards.md#bounties)



## What is the difference between Enthusiast and Pro Users?
The difference is:
- Enthusiasts are not allowed to use CodeGlass in commercial environments, like at work, and cannot be funded or reimbursed for by a company.
- Requesting more free Concurrent device activations.

## Why should you become an enthusiast
By starters, they get access to the [Pro Edition](../Editions/Pro.md) of CodeGlass. More importantly, you support the development of CodeGlass because we would like nothing more than keep developing on it, but without your support, that is not possible.
