## Perpetual Fallback License Requirements

Yes, it becomes a [Fallback License](FallbackLicense.md) when not renewed after 12 months of uninterrupted subscription payments.
(With an annual subscription, you would instantly get the fallback license)

Downgrading your subscription to a [Pro Subscription](ProSubscription.md) does not reset this time; we don't want to punish you for trying out new features :) 

Take note that the [Fallback License](FallbackLicense.md) does not support Multiple concurrent software users or Offline.
