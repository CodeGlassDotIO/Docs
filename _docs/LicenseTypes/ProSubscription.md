## What is the difference between Enthusiast and Pro Subscription?

Yes, it becomes a [Fallback License](FallbackLicense.md) or a [Community License](CommunityLicense.md) by:

- when not renewed after 12 months of uninterrupted subscription payments, it becomes a [Fallback License](FallbackLicense.md).
(With an Annual subscription you would instantly get the fallback license)
Upgrading your subscription to a [Experimental Subscription](ExperimentalSubscription.md) does not reset this time; however, we don't want to punish you for trying out new features :) 
- when not renewed after at least two months of uninterrupted subscription payments, it becomes a [Community License](CommunityLicense.md).
