# Community Edition
This is the free edition of Code Glass, with some [limitations](#limitations).


This edition is ment for people that do not have the funds or method to pay for the [Pro Edition](Pro.md).<br/>
However if you can we would be very greatefull if you looked at getting a [Pro Edition](Pro.md) as it allows us to [future develop](../Roadmap.md) Code Glass.

You can also get this edition as a thank you for previously paying for a subscription as part of the [Fallback License Grant](../LicenseTypes.md#fallback-license-type-requirements)


See the [avaiable to licenses](#available-to-licenses) section to see how to get this edition.
