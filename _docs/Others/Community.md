# CodeGlass Community

This is still a work in progress, but outlined what we are trying to do:

We are trying to build this software around a community as it is our believe this will make the (/any) product better.
This includes:
- Reacting on their needs and wishes
- Giving [credits](Credits.md) where credits are due
- Giving out [rewards](Rewards.md) to community members

in return the community would:
- Give quality feedback.
- Help out with issues.
- Help other users with CodeGlass.
- Vote on new features

Like this we also do not have to add any analytics, we can just ask our user base instead of secretly collecting their data.

Like we said, we are still working it out but you can start by joining our [discord](../../pages/contact.md#discord)
