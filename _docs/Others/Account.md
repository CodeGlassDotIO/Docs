# CodeGlass Account

Currently CodeGlass does not have a managed account, this will be added in the future, escpecially when we have furture use for it.

For now when you will get the following accounts:
- Always a [LicenseSpring CodeGlass Account](#licensespring-codeglass-account) for managing subscription usage and users.
- Sometimes a [Stripe CodeGlass Account](#stripe-codeglass-account) for managing your subscription, like billing.


# User Account
With user account we mean the account that you have to [login](../views/Splashscreen.md) into CodeGlass with.

You get this account by:
- Buying or getting a subscription for CodeGlass; or
- A License Manager will create one for you.

This account is the same as the [License Spring CodeGlass Account](#licensespring-codeglass-account).


A License manager is the owner of a ([Offline](../LicenseTypes/OfflineOrganisationSubscription.md))[Organization](../LicenseTypes/OrganisationSubscription.md) or [Experimental](../LicenseTypes/ExperimentalSubscription.md) subscription.<br/>
The manager can login into [https://users.licensespring.com/login](https://users.licensespring.com/login) with Company ID "CodeGlass" and create a user account for you.



# LicenseSpring CodeGlass Account
After you gained a license or subscription for CodeGlass you get an email from LicenseSpring including an account.

With this account you can also login in the LicenseSpring End User account with company ID "CodeGlass" at: [https://users.licensespring.com/login](https://users.licensespring.com/login)

Here you can manage your account and reset device registrationd.

With this account you can also [login](../views/Splashscreen.md) into CodeGlass,


If you have a ([Offline](../LicenseTypes/OfflineOrganisationSubscription.md))[Organization](../LicenseTypes/OrganisationSubscription.md) or [Experimental](ExperimentalSubscription) subscription you are assigned as "License Manager" and can create users account for others to [login](../views/Splashscreen.md) with into CodeGlass.

# Stripe CodeGlass Account
In some cases and in all cases that you payed for your subscription you get a Stripe CodeGlass Account, here you can manage your subscription and billing, including cancelling your subscription.

The username is the email adress you used when you bought a subscription and should in be the same as your [LicenseSpring CodeGlass Account](#licensespring-codeglass-account)
