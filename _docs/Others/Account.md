# CodeGlass Account

Currently CodeGlass does not have a managed account, this will be added in the future, escpecially when we have furture use for it.

For now when you will get the following accounts:
- Always a [LicenseSpring CodeGlass Account](#licensespring-codeglass-account) for managing subscription usage and users.
- Sometimes a [Stripe CodeGlass Account](#stripe-codeglass-account) for managing your subscription, like billing.


# User Account
With user account we mean the account that you have to [login](../views/Splashscreen.md) into CodeGlass with.

You get this account by:
- Buying or getting a subscription for CodeGlass; or
- A [License Manager](CodeGlassLicensePortal.md#license-manager) will create one for you.

This account is the same as the [License Spring CodeGlass Account](#licensespring-codeglass-account).




# LicenseSpring CodeGlass Account
After you gained a license or subscription for CodeGlass you get an email from LicenseSpring including an account.
With this account you can [login](../views/Splashscreen.md) into CodeGlass.

You can read more about this acount [here](CodeGlassLicensePortal.md). 

If you are a [License Manager](CodeGlassLicensePortal.md#license-manager) you can also create users account for others to [login](../views/Splashscreen.md) with into CodeGlass.

# Stripe CodeGlass Account
In some cases and in all cases that you payed for your subscription you get a Stripe CodeGlass Account, here you can manage your subscription and billing, including cancelling your subscription.

The username is the email adress you used when you bought a subscription and should in be the same as your [LicenseSpring CodeGlass Account](#licensespring-codeglass-account)

You can read more about this account [here](ChangeSubscription.md)
