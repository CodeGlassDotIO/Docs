# CodeGlass Account

Currently CodeGlass does not have a managed account, this will be added in the future, escpecially when we have furture use for it.

For now when you will get the following accounts:
- Always a [LicenseSpring CodeGlass Account](#licensespring-codeglass-account) for managing subscription usage and users.
- Sometimes a [Stripe CodeGlass Account](#stripe-codeglass-account) for managing your subscription, like billing.

# LicenseSpring CodeGlass Account
After you gained a license or subscription for CodeGlass you get an email from LicenseSpring including an account.


With this account you can also login in the LicenseSpring End User account with company ID "TySoft" at: [https://users.licensespring.com/login](https://users.licensespring.com/login)

Here you can manage your account and reset device registrationd and if you have more than 1 Concurrent software users then you can also manage those there.

This is also the account you have to use to [login](../views/Splashscreen.md) into CodeGlass.

# Stripe CodeGlass account
In some cases and in all cases that you payed for your license you get a Stripe CodeGlass Account, here you can manage your subscription and billing, including cancelling your subscription.

The username is the email adress you used when you bought a subscription and should in be the same as your [LicenseSpring CodeGlass Account](#licensespring-codeglass-account)

You can access it through [https://mysuperportal.com/access/codeglass/](https://mysuperportal.com/access/codeglass/)
