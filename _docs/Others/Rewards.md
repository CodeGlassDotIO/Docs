# Rewards Program

The rewards program is still a work in progress.

Together with the [community](Community.md) and [credits](Credits.md), we want to reward people for their contributions to CodeGlass, like reward someone that helped out a long time in the community.

They would be [credited](Credits.md) but also gain a free license/subscription (upgrade) or get multiple months or years for free.

## Bounties
We also want to introduce bounties, something you can do to gain a specific reward. 

Like someone that would already reward someone for is a working sample of using the JVM TI (Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface), additional points if it is working with the profiling API for our future support of Java :D 

Like we said, we are still working this program out, but if you already have something, please join our [discord](../../pages/contact.md#discord).
