You can change your subscription any time to better fit your needs.

You can do this by going to using your [Stripe CodeGlass Account](Account.md#stripe-codeglass-account).
For most of you it is the same email you use to [login](../views/Splashscreen.md#login) into CodeGlass.

With this email you can get a magic login link mailed to you at [https://mysuperportal.com/access/codeglass/](https://mysuperportal.com/access/codeglass/).

The link in your email should bring you to a page similar to this:

![assets/img/Stripe/Stripe_MySuperPortal.png](../../assets/img/Stripe/Stripe_MySuperPortal.png)

And click on the "Access - CUS_..." button, if you do not see that button click [here](#no-access-button)

You should get a page similar to this:

![assets/img/Stripe/Stripe_Subscription.png](../../assets/img/Stripe/Stripe_Subscription.png)

And you should see two buttons, ["Update plan"](#update-plan) or ["Cancel plan"](#cancel-plan) button

if you do not see a ["Update plan"](#update-plan) button, click [here](#no-update-plan-button)

If you do not see any button at all, click [here](#no-subscription)



## Update Plan

![assets/img/Stripe/Stripe_UpdatePlan.png](../../assets/img/Stripe/Stripe_UpdatePlan.png)

On this screen you can buy additional subscritpions of the same type by clicking the "Update quantity" button or upgrade to another subscription by selecting one below. <br/>

{% include alertNoTitle.html  type="info" content="You can only have one type of subscription per email address, if you need multiple types you can use a different email adres."  %}

By buying multiple subscriptions, you can use the software concurrently for the number of purchased subscriptions and unlock additional user accounts for ([offline](../LicenseTypes/OfflineOrganisationSubscription.md)) [organization](../LicenseTypes/OrganisationSubscription.md) and [experimental](../LicenseTypes/ExperimentalSubscription.md) subscriptions.


Changes to your subscription are immediately applied, and the cost difference is prorated.


{% include alertNoTitle.html  type="warning" content="Remaining prorated credit will got to your Stipe Account Balance and will be used on next payments."  %}





## Cancel Plan
![assets/img/Stripe/Stripe_CancelPlan.png](../../assets/img/Stripe/Stripe_CancelPlan.png)

You can cancel or pause your subscription on this screen, and you can still use your subscription until the end of your term.

{% include alertNoTitle.html  type="info" content="If you want to lower the quantity of subscription you have to go to the update plan page instead"  %}







# FAQ

## No Access Button
If you do not see an access button you have most likely not entered a email that is tied to a subscription.
It can also happen if:

- The email you entered is not the ["License Manager"](Account.md#licensespring-codeglass-Account) Email.
    You have to contact the person that you got the license from.
- You received your subscription for free and do not have a [Stripe CodeGlass Account](Account.md#stripe-codeGlass-account).
    You can just buy a subscription from the [store](https://codeglass.io/offers)
