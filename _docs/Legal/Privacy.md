# Our privacy policy

Very simple, we do not collect any personal data :) <br/>
And perhaps you already notice we do not have an annoying cookie popup begging for your personal data? :) <br/>

We also do not have an annoying automated news letter, if you want to keep up to date we recommend joining our [discord](../../pages/contact.md#discord) and you can always read the [news](../../pages/news.md) at a time convenient to yourself.

However we use 3rd parties that (probably) collects a few things, here they are:
- [Licensespring](https://licensespring.com/privacy) as our license provider.
- [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/privacy) as our payment provider.
- [SuperPortal](https://mysuperportal.com/access/codeglass/) they state: We don't store any customer data other than an email addressâ€”this is required to access the (stripe customer) portal. After each session is over, the data is deleted from our database.
- [Formspree](https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy) in case you use the contact form on the landing site.
We will not share your data with any other 3rd party. <br/>
We do not store any of the above data ourself.

We use their collected data
- To manage your [account](../Others/Account.md)
- To contact you for non marketing purposes (e.g. License agreement changed)
- To use in payment related actions as described in [Terms And Conditions Of Purchase](TermsAndConditionsOfPurchase.md#personal-data)
- Maybe for really cool mayor updates we will send you an email that we just want to shout from all rooftops (we are proud of our software ok :) ) 

And two legal statement our legal advisor forced us to make....
- Our sites may contain links to third-party sites. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.
- We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by our 3rd parties.
