# Our privacy policy
Very simple, CodeGlass is led by its Developers and is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. As such, we have implemented measures to ensure that we do not collect any personal data from our users. You may have noticed that we do not have intrusive cookie pop-ups soliciting your personal information. We also refrain from sending automated newsletters. Instead, we recommend joining our Discord community to stay updated,[discord](../../pages/contact.md#discord) and you can always read the [news](https://codeglass.io/blog.html) at a time convenient to yourself.

We also have a marketing team, but they must get your explicit consent before contacting you. And we prevent them from obscuring these efforts by pointing these, like checkboxes, out every time.

However, it's important to note that we utilize certain third-party services that may collect limited data. Here is an overview of the third-party services we utilize:
