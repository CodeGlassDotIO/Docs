# CodeGlass Data Collection Profilers
CodeGlass is made with remote profiling and support for any language in mind. Because of this, CodeGlass exists out of multiple parts:
- [CodeGlass Client](CodeGlassClient.md)
- [CodeGlass Hub](CodeGlassHub.md)
- CodeGlass Profilers

At CodeGlass, when we speak of profilers, we only mean the **Data Collection** portion of a profiler. This is because processing the data is done on the [Hub](CodeGlassHub.md) and display the data is done on the [Client](CodeGlassClient.md).

For more information about the languages we support, see [supported runtimes](supportedruntimes.md).
