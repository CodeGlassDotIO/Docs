# Memory Profiling
With our [realtime profiling](../features/RealtimeDataCollection.md) we are able to solve many problems other profilers can't. With our memory profiler we can also help with memory related problems and help you find the parts of your application that consume a lot of memory.

First there are the dedicated memory statistics view like the onces here:
